Mythos As A Service
===================

Mythos As A Service is a simple online generator of Cthulhoid entities -- that is, 
Great Old Ones, creatures and strange peoples from Lovecraft Country. 

Tech-wise, it is a simple Express project coupled with a random cthulhoid name generator and 
a list of outr√© adjectives. 

It is both a web app and a JSON service source. 

Is this software used somewhere?
